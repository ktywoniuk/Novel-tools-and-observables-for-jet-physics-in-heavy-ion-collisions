\section{Introduction}

In recent years, observables involving fully reconstructed jets, produced in heavy-ion collisions, have been established as important tools to probe the properties of the underlying hot and dense QCD medium. From a reciprocal point of view, they also shed light on the details of parton fragmentation and hadronisation in the presence of final-state interactions. These developments are mainly driven by a dedicated experimental effort that aim at fully exploit the detector capabilities and experimental techniques at current high-energy colliders. On the theory side, an enhanced level of sophistication of the modeling of both jet fragmentation and its coupling to the medium evolution, often implemented as Monte-Carlo parton showers or event generators, allow to scrutinize the details of jet-medium interactions using a wide range of high-$\pT$ processes.

Jets are excellent probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) for several reasons; here we briefly outline but a few. Firstly, since they are multi-parton objects containing color degrees of freedom they are affected by final-state interactions with a deconfined medium. Secondly, in course of their evolution jets can probe various length scales of the QGP, providing a complementary window with regard to bulk observables that are dominated by soft physics.

The way in which high-$\pT$ observables in heavy-ion collisions deviate from baseline measurements in proton-proton collisions is generically referred to as ``jet quenching''. This term arose historically in connection with the  first data on the suppression on high-$\pT$ hadron suppression and related di-jet/photon-jet asymmetries measured at RHIC. These processes clearly involve a large variety of scales, ranging from the jet scale to thermal scales of the QGP, as will also be explained in more detail below. Typical jet quenching observables will therefore be sensitive to perturbative and non-perturbative contributions in varying degree. This can complicate the interpretation of the considered observables and obfuscate the extraction of information about the underlying medium. Besides, additional background subtraction algorithms have to be applied in the more noisy heavy-ion environment, complicating the procedure of statistically removing detector effects (unfolding). Therefore a joint community effort between theory and experiment is crucial to fully take advantage of the potential of these QGP probes. 

Many of these complications are less pressing or absent when measuring single-hadron spectra or hadron correlations. Hence, one notable example of such an joint effort was the so-called ``brick problem'' \cite{Armesto:2011ht,Burke:2013yra}, organized by the TECHQM collaboration \cite{TECHQM}, which aimed at clarify differences and similarities between various theoretical implementations of jet quenching on the level of single-hadron spectra in heavy-ion collisions. The simplification allowing for such a comprehensive comparison was to reduce the complexity of the modeling of the underlying medium to a static, one-dimensional ``brick'' with constant density. 
%While the employed models gave, as a result of comparison with the data, a wide spread of the obtained fundamental parameters, 
Based on this exercise, it resulted in a comprehensive effort to estimate the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$ along with its uncertainties \cite{Burke:2013yra}.

The joint organization of the 5th Heavy Ion Workshop and CERN TH institute ``Novel tools and observables for jet physics in heavy-ion collisions'' took place at CERN 25 August -- 1 September 2017 \cite{THinst}. The main objective of the meeting was to bring together experimentalists and theorists in order to identify relevant jet observables that are sensitive to different aspects of the final-state interactions with the dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions and study the added potential of jet substructure techniques in this context.

Due to the high level of complexity related to the experimental determination and theoretical treatment of jet observables, a comprehensive effort of comparing models against each other and against data on a wide range of observables is out of  scope and, probably, would not allow to draw meaningful conclusions. Instead, the workshop provided an opportunity to consider jet observables in heavy-ion collisions from a new perspective to a large extent made available through novel substructure techniques.
This report sums up the main discussions that took place during the meeting, and presents a selected number of numerical studies using existing tools. These mainly include the Monte Carlo (MC) event generators PYTHIA 8 \cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} for simulating the proton-proton baseline, and in-medium jet evolution codes QPYTHIA \cite{Armesto:2009fj} and JEWEL \cite{Zapp:2011ya,Zapp:2012ak}. 
%{\color{red} Some details about main assumptions and building blocks of JEWEL and Q-PYTHIA. Appendix?}
We refer the interested reader to Appendix~\ref{app:models} for further details on the MC's utilized in the studies presented below. The selected parton shower MC's were used for sake of convenience, and we look forward to extend the suite of studied generators, including MARTINI \cite{Schenke:2009gb,Young:2011ug}, HYDJET++ \cite{Lokhtin:2008xi}, YaJEM \cite{Renk:2010zx} and MATTER \cite{Majumder:2013re} as well as newly developed codes, most notably JETSCAPE \cite{Cao:2017zih}, in future editions of the workshop. In addition, for jet reconstruction we made extensive use of FastJet \cite{Cacciari:2005hq,Cacciari:2011ma} and for the purposes of additional pile-up mitigation in heavy-ion context, we studied constituent subtraction (CS) \cite{Berta:2014eza} and SoftKiller (SK) \cite{Cacciari:2014gra}.

We organize the report according to two main motifs. In the first part, \autoref{sec:phasespace}, we introduce for the first time, in the context of heavy-ion studies, the concept of a splitting map, based on the Lund kinematical diagram \cite{Andersson:1988gp}. Filling this map gives a operational representation of the radiation pattern implemented in a given showering algorithm. It also provides a direct, visual impression of what phase space region is being most significantly modified by medium effects. In detail, 
\begin{description}

\item[\autoref{sec:phasespace-theory}] gives a brief introduction to theoretical concepts that are useful for understanding the Lund diagram on the level of a single splitting, both for vacuum showers and showers in the medium.

\item[\autoref{sec:iterative-declustering}] describes in detail the procedure to fill the splitting map, by describing the steps related to jet reclustering and calculation of the variables that go into the map. In particular, we study the impact of changing the reclustering algorithm, giving rise to different jet ``histories'' on the level of the PYTHIA vacuum shower. 

\item[\autoref{sec:phasespace-mc}] presents a study of the splitting maps of in-medium MC parton showers, QPYTHIA and JEWEL. Finally, in \autoref{sec:uncorrelatedbackground}, we study the resilience of the observed   features at generator level to uncorrelated background by embedding the jet samples into a realistic heavy-ion environment.

\end{description}
While the splitting maps contain the maximal amount of information, since they accumulate the kinematics of every splitting, they are also amenable to more exclusive examinations for instance through the implementation of jet ``tagging'' and ``grooming'' procedures. These tools are extensively used in the high-energy community \cite{Bendavid:2018nar} for a wide range of purposes, spanning jet substructure studies and leveraging this control for studies of observables beyond pure QCD, see e.g. \cite{Larkoski:2017jix,Asquith:2018igt} for the most recent reviews. They have also been previously applied in Monte-Carlo studies for heavy-ion collisions \cite{Zhang:2015trf,Apolinario:2017qay,Milhano:2017nzm}. 
In studying concrete observables, we have mainly focussed on applying the so-called Soft Drop (SD) grooming procedure \cite{Larkoski:2014wba}, to be detailed below, that aims at identifying the first hard jet branching. 
Hence, in the second part of the report, \autoref{sec:jetsubstructure}, we perform a set of MC studies, on generator level and including embedding into a realistic heavy-ion background, using state-of-the-art grooming techniques. These observables are however, not limited to substructure but are also used in order to extract more differential aspects from inclusive jet observables. In detail, 
\begin{description}
\item[\autoref{sec:groomedobservables}] presents the result for the groomed momentum-fraction $z_g$, subjet angle $\Delta R_{12}$ and the groomed mass  $M_g$ for QPYTHIA and JEWEL using three grooming settings (in this section, the studies were performed on generator level). We shed more light on the robustness of these results by checking the size of hadronization effects in the $z_g$ distribution for three different SD settings \autoref{sec:hadronization}. As in \autoref{sec:iterative-declustering}, we also perform a brief study on how the reclustering algorithms modify the distributions.
\item[\autoref{sec:dissecting}] suggests a complementary look on substructure by submitting the jet sample that goes in to constructing a fully inclusive observable to an additional grooming step. Concretely, we propose to ``dissect'' the jet sample using SD grooming and bin the data in terms of the angular separation of the hardest subjets, $\Delta R_{12}$. We demonstrate this procedure on QPYTHIA and JEWEL samples for the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the photon-jet imbalance.
\end{description}
Finally, we wrap up with an outlook in \autoref{sec:outlook}.
